"I Will Always Love You" is a song written and originally recorded by American singer and songwriter Dolly Parton in 1973.[1] Her country version of the track was released as a single in 1974. It was written as a farewell to her one-time partner and mentor Porter Wagoner upon Parton's decision to pursue a solo career.[2]
Parton's version of "I Will Always Love You" attained commercial success, twice reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chartâ€”first in June 1974, and again in October 1982, with her re-recording. With this accomplishment Parton became the first artist ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song.
